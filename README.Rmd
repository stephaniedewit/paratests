# paratests

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of paratests is to make performing (non-)parametric tests in R easier and more reproducible. Today this package contains four functions:

* __anova()__: print the p value of an analysis of variance summary
* __cor_scatterplot()__: scatterplot of variables and their correlation test coefficient and p value
* __mean_barchart()__: barchart of a variable mean and standard deviation per group
* __sw_tidy()__: print the p value of a Shapiro Wilk normality test

Every function has to be performed on a tidy dataset.

## Installation

You can install the development version of paratests from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stephaniedewit/paratests")
```

## Examples

For an example of each function use `?anova()`, `?cor_scatterplot()`, `?mean_barchart()` and `?sw_tidy`. For a vignette with a short analysis combining the four functions use `browseVignettes("paratests")`.
